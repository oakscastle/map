    <h1>A Church Door</h1>

    <hr />

    <p>When Martin Luther nailed <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninety-Five_Theses'><cite>The Ninety-Five Theses</cite></a> on the door of All Saints' Church, it wasn't because it was a church. During his time, the church door was the place for people in the community to introduce information into the community. This project is to build a vitrual church door, and eventually develop <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics'>mechanisms for the community to mediate content</a>.</p>

    <p>The initial installation in currently planned for <a href='http://thewillowtreejc.com'>The Willow Tree</a>. The medium will be an image back-projected on a window. The window under consideration is:</p>

    <p>The window is 67". With a 3" border on each side, that's a width of 61". If the projector is using a <acronym title='High-Definition Televison'>HDTV</acronym> aspect ratio of 16:9, that's a height of ~35.5".</p>
